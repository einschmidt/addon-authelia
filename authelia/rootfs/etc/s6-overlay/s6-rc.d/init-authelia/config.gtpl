# Authelia Configuration File
#
# Below are the typical settings that could be configured here 
# but are instead set via environment variables:
#
# server:
#   address: "tcp://:9091"  # Authelia listens on port 9091 inside the container.
#                           # When running as a Home Assistant add-on, the external 
#                           # port can be remapped in the add-on configuration.
#
# storage:
#   local:
#     path: "/data/db.sqlite3"  # SQLite database file location
#   encryption_key: "/data/secrets/storage_encryption_key"  # Encryption key for storage
#
# identity_validation:
#   reset_password:
#     jwt_secret: "/data/secrets/jwt_secret"  # Secret for password reset JWTs
#
# session:
#   secret: "/data/secrets/session_secret"  # Secret used for session encryption
#
# Auto-Generated Keys and Secrets:
# - All required keys and secrets (JWT secret, session secret, storage encryption key) 
#   are automatically generated during installation.
# - These secrets are securely stored in `/data/secrets/` and referenced via environment variables.
#
# Why These Shouldn't Be Configured Here:
# - Environment variables always override configuration file values.
# - Keeping secrets and critical paths in environment variables improves security.
